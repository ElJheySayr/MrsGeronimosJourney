# Mrs. Geronimo's Journey

“**Mrs. Geronimo's Journey**” is a simulation game that depicts a day in the life of a college professor named Sheila Geronimo. Sheila is my OJT adviser, and she assigned me to create a game about her daily life as a teacher. This game highlights both the challenges and the inspiring aspects of being an educator.

The game is a single-player, first-person simulation story game that portrays the life of a college professor.
